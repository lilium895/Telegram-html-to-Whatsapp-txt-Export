# Telegram-html-to-Whatsapp-txt-Export

DISCLAIMER: I haven't tried it yet
This code is base on the work of Suberbia html_to_txt converter.
It should convert a telegram chat export html into a Whatsapp chat export txt.
To make it work you have to change messages.html with the path of your html file, then run it.
Once the chat.txt is created you have to zip the file with all the attachments (medias, files, voice_messages...).
Put it your phone. Then Telegram should import it.
